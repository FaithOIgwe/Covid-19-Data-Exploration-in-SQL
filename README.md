## Covid-19 Deaths Analysis in SQL
I carried out an analysis of Covid 19 Deaths, with data gotten from ourworldindata.com. The purpose behind this project was to help individuals understand how deadly the  Covid-19 virus can be and also to encourage individuals to follow every guideline that has been stated by WHO to combat the spread of this deadly virus.

My analysis was guided by the following parameters:
• How many deaths has been recorded between 2020- 2022?

• Which year had the most deaths and why?

• Which Continents have recorded the most deaths?

• Which Continents have recorded the least deaths so far and how have they been able to do 
that?

• Where are the High-Risk Countries?

• Recommendations and Findings

## Superstore sale exploration and analysis in SQL
In this project I analyzed the Annual report of the superstore dataset (2003-2004), to help the stakeholders understand key business indicators and see where it’s necessary to improve or exceed performance expectations.
My Analysis and Exploration was guided by the follwing parameters:
 1. What is the sales trend across years?
 2. What is the best and least selling products?
 3. What is the best month to sell at superstore?
 4. Are there products that go well togther?
 5. Who are our best clients?
 6. What is the average sale per year, month and day?
 7. Recommendations and findings.
