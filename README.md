I carried out an analysis of Covid 19 Deaths, with data gotten from ourworldindata.com. The purpose behind this project was to help individuals understand how deadly the  Covid-19 virus can be and also to encourage individuals to follow every guideline that has been stated by WHO to combat the spread of this deadly virus.

My analysis was guided by the following parameters:
• How many deaths has been recorded between 2020- 2022?

• Which year had the most deaths and why?

• Which Continents have recorded the most deaths?

• Which Continents have recorded the least deaths so far and how have they been able to do 
that?

• Where are the High-Risk Countries?

• Recommendations and Findings

## Superstore sale exploration and analysis in SQL
![Sample superstore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108904370/203080308-53134ef8-80fc-4f56-af32-cd402c8976f4.jpg)

In this project I analyzed the Annual report of the superstore dataset (2003-2004), to help the stakeholders understand key business indicators and see where it’s necessary to improve or exceed performance expectations.
My Analysis and Exploration was guided by the follwing parameters:
 1. What is the sales trend across years?
 2. What is the best and least selling products?
 3. What is the best month to sell at superstore?
 4. Are there products that go well togther?
 5. Who are our best clients?
 6. What is the average sale per year, month and day?
 7. Recommendations and findings.

## Tourism across Years
![rolands-varsbergs-miKmVyq3qhE-unsplash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108904370/203080076-032000cc-b701-4216-9e69-27abf55bda67.jpg)

In this project I played the  role of Analytics Lead for FestMan. I analyzed 60,000 records  of toruist travels across years, helping tourist discover the best destination and location for their next trip using the records of past tourists, their origin country and destination country for travel, rating of the hotels, how long they stayed and the amount spent. This will help future tourists discover the best next place for their vacation.

I really enjoyed querying this data as I love travelling and have worked in a hotel before, so it was easy to play the role of a tourist on the one hand and drilled the data to better understand it and help  stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
 Analysis Guidelines
1. Top Destination for Customers?
2. Provide insights on Top countries Customers prefer to visit.
3. Customers profile and demographics?
4.Analyze the data to provide insights demographics of the Customers such as the Age groups, Gender and location.
5. Top Hotels by Booking and Rating?
6. Analyze the data to provide insights on most preferred hotel by Customers and Hotels with high user rating.
7. Where are most of the tourist coming from?
8. Which Locations do they visit more when they treavel?
9. What is the averag, minimum and maximum times tourists have stayed in the hotels?
10. What is the tourist best and least hotel choice and is is affected my seasonality?
11. When is the best time tourist travel, analyzing the data by year, month and days to find trends?
12. What is the best way tourists pay 
13. Is there a top bank our clients use?

## Danny's Diner 8 week SQL challenge 
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108904370/203078785-ab361c28-51b7-412f-ab78-abe2589f6e20.png)

Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

sales
menu
members

### WEEEK 1 CASE STUDY QUESTIONS 

Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
Which item was the most popular for each customer?
Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
