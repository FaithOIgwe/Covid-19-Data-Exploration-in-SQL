## Covid-19 Deaths Analysis in SQL
I carried out an analysis of Covid 19 Deaths, with data gotten from ourworldindata.com. The purpose behind this project was to help individuals understand how deadly the  Covid-19 virus can be and also to encourage individuals to follow every guideline that has been stated by WHO to combat the spread of this deadly virus.

My analysis was guided by the following parameters:
• How many deaths has been recorded between 2020- 2022?

• Which year had the most deaths and why?

• Which Continents have recorded the most deaths?

• Which Continents have recorded the least deaths so far and how have they been able to do 
that?

• Where are the High-Risk Countries?

• Recommendations and Findings
